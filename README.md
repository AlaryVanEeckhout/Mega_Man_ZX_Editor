# Mega_Man_ZX_Editor
## What this is
 This is an attempt at creating a tool that will make editing Mega Man ZX much easier.
## Progress
### Done
- Dialogue text converter
### Todo
- Functional User Interface
- Sprite Editor
- Sound/Music Editor*
- Movie Editor*
- Physics Editor*
- Level Editor*
- Game Logic Editor*

*This feature may not be implemented/is not currently prioritized since I haven't looked into it and it looks hard to do at first glance. 
## Setup for usage
Currently, there are no releases and I'm not sure how to include the dependencies in my project, so:
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Now that you have Python, you can use pip(Package Installer for Python) to install the two following modules:
- [Download&Install NDS Py](https://pypi.org/project/ndspy/)
- [Download&Install PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
- This project > Code > Download ZIP
- Extract the contents of the .zip file to a folder wherever you want
- That's it! Now you can run RunEditor.bat (or run MME_NDS.py, from command line)
