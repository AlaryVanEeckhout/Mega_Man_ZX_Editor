# Mega_Man_ZX_Editor
## What this is
 This is an attempt at creating a tool that will make editing Mega Man ZX much easier.
## Setup for usage
Currently, there are no releases and I'm not sure how to include the dependencies in my project, so:
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install NDS Py](https://pypi.org/project/ndspy/)
- [Install PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
- That's it! Now you can run RunEditor.bat (or run MME_NDS.py from command line)
